# One Lone Coder examples... in VB!

I stumbled across [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder) and I couldn't resist the idea of abusing the Windows Console to act as graphics output device; however, all of his code is written in C++. So the only ways that I could jump in an play with this is to either do it in C++ or, well, rewrite it all in VB. As you can probably guess, I chose the later.

Right now the main focus is on the olcConsoleGameEngine (CGE) which as since been retired and replaced with olcPixelGameEngine, which subsequently was replaced by olcPixelGameEngine 2.0. As I work through his videos (in reverse chronological order), I'll continue to update this repo as I progress.

- [olcConsoleGameEngine](CGE/README.md)
- [olcPixelGameEngine 1.0](PGE1/README.md)
- [Other](Other/README.md)
