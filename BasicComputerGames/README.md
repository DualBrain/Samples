# BASIC COMPUTER GAMES

## What are we doing?

This project is about migrating the games from the first computer book to sell over a million copies... [BASIC Computer Games](https://annarchive.com/files/Basic_Computer_Games_Microcomputer_Edition.pdf)!

These games were originally written to target MBASIC, the version of Microsoft BASIC prior to GW-BASIC and QBasic.

Given the these versions of basic are the grandparent, great grandparent and the great-great grandparents of modern VB, the idea 
is to convert these projects so that they not only execute but also retain some of this *legacy* that harkens back to these original 
dialects of BASIC.

## Where can we discuss it?

Please join us over on our Discord server for any discussion for a worklog and conversation around this project.
