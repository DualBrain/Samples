# QBasic

Microsoft QBasic (or more specifically Microsoft QuickBasic and it's baby brother) is a direct precursor to modern VB.

There were several examples that shipped with MS-DOS 5.0 (along with QBasic 1.0) and this section serves to pay honor to those by migrating them to .NET with minimal structural changes in an effort to respect the original material.

- Gorilla
- Nibbles
- RemLine

NOTE: These projects leverage the QB.Compatibility library that can be found seperately in my repos.
