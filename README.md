# Samples, Samples, Samples

Welcome to the Cory Smith (DualBrain) Sample Repo... feel free to browse around and, hopefully, make some happy discoveries.

## One Lone Coder

[OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder) has some really awesome videos on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9/videos) and a pretty interesting game engine that, well, abuses the Windows Console and bends it to his will as a "game" output device. This intrigues me to no end and I so wanted to play with stuff, but alas it is all in C++. I could, of course, just use C++ and *get over it* but that just isn't the way I do things. As I see it, there was a need (at least for me) to have it in VB! It was taunting me and I simply had to cowboy up and gitterdun. This section of the Samples repo contains the ongoing results of this effort.

## BASIC Computer Games

The classic book BASIC Computer Games by David H. Ahl (1970's) contains many games that worked on the Microsoft MBASIC BASIC dialect which is the foundation for the Microsoft BASIC's to follow... including, of course, VB.  This folder contains many of these games converted to VB.  What makes my contribution to this sort of project different than many others is that:

- BASIC to BASIC being the first obvious difference.
- Retain as much fidelity as possible.
- And, in a strange twist to the story, in many cases actually reduce the total number of lines while simultaneously improving readability.

I draw attention to the last bullet point as most, if not all, of the the examples I've seen that attempt to migrate these samples to something newer tend to be much larger as a result - or if the goal was to reduce, the results are not really readable.  With VB, it is possible to not only reduce but retain readability... win-win.

## ClearScript

As far as I can tell, ClearScript is a new project from Microsoft announced around January 2022 to provide an easy means to incorporate
and provide a scripting engine in your application.

## GUI

This folder contains many examples related to the my exploration of various
projects that provide for video output for the VB (or rather, .NET) developer.

## QBasic

I've seen many a conversation that VB, specifically the .NET dialect, isn't really BASIC.  The projects in this folder contains conversions of
several of the included samples that shipped with MS-DOS 5.0 converted to
VB with an effort to retain as much fidelity as possible to demonstrate 
that VB, although different, is also very much familiar.
